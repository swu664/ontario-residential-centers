# ontario-residential-centers

This project involved rebuilding and unifying a group of static websites for a local residential care provider. The original sites were created using a website builder (Webflow), and this project replaces them with a clean, maintainable codebase using custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Purpose

The goal was to improve how information is structured and presented across the organization’s web presence by:

- Merging three previously separate sites into one centralized platform
- Improving section cohesion and layout readability
- Making the site easier to maintain and extend in the future
- Aligning more closely with SEO best practices by consolidating content under one domain

The result is a responsive, accessible, and better-organized informational website that more accurately reflects the organization’s professionalism, values, and offerings.

## Deployment

Deployment is currently pending final approval and is planned via Netlify (https://netlify.com), using GitHub-based auto-deploy (CI/CD). This setup will allow any future changes to be made quickly and reliably by simply pushing updates to the repository.

Once approved, the site will be publicly hosted under a custom domain to consolidate SEO across previously separate web properties.
