            <h2>Respite Services</h2>
            <p>Respite care offers families a much-needed break — whether for a weekend, during a crisis, or as part of ongoing support. 
                At our residential centers, we partner with families and agencies 
                to create flexible, compassionate respite programs tailored to each individual's needs. 
                Every respite guest has access to the same caring staff, safe environment, and enriching programs as our full-time residents.

                we respond with compassion, structure, and support when families need it most.
            </p>
            <p>The importance of this kind of care was highlighted in a 2016 report by the Ontario Ombudsman, 
                calling for greater responsiveness to individuals in crisis — a call we are proud to answer.
